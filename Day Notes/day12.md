## Assignments to cfreate agents

1. Design devops agents for self healing of the pipelines and debug the errors when pipeline runs 24/7.
2. Design agents which can analyze the k8s logs once you deploy the app in k8s, which will read, analyze, identify errors, send alerts from logs.
3. Design agent that will write the pipeline based on the nlp.
4. Design agent which understand monitoring dashbords and threshold, the agent has to create alert and send it to slack, it should create alert based on the prompts.
